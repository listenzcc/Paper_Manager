## Abstract

Deep learning algorithms are a subset of the machine learning algorithms, which aim at discovering multiple levels of distributed representations. Recently, numerous deep learning algorithms have been proposed to solve traditional artificial intelligence problems. This work aims to review the state-of-the art in deep learning algorithms in computer vision by highlighting the contributions and challenges from over 210 recent research papers. It first gives an overview of various deep learning approaches and their recent developments, and then briefly describes their applications in diverse vision tasks, such as image classification, object detection, image retrieval, semantic segmentation and human pose estimation. Finally, the paper summarizes the future trends and challenges in designing and training deep neural networks.

## Conclusion

This paper presents a comprehensive review of deep learning and develops a categorization scheme to analyze the existing deep learning literature. It divides the deep learning algorithms into four categories according to the basic model they derived from: Convolutional Neural Networks, Restricted Boltzmann Machines, Autoencoder and Sparse Coding. The state-of-the-art approaches of the four classes are discussed and analyzed in detail. For the applications in the computer vision domain, the paper mainly reports the advancements of CNN based schemes, as it is the most extensively utilized and most suitable for images. Most notably, some recent articles have reported inspiring advances showing that some CNN-based algorithms have already exceeded the accuracy of human raters.
Despite the promising results reported so far, there is significant room for further advances. For example, the underlying theoretical foundation does not yet explain under what conditions they will perform well or outperform other approaches, and how to determine the optimal structure for a certain task. This paper describes these challenges and summarizes the new trends in designing and training deep neural networks, along with several directions that may be further explored in the future.
